Question 3: Code walkthrough

- The code sets up a FastAPI application with routes for adding books and reviews, and for retrieving books and reviews based on various criteria. 
It interacts with SQLlite database using SQLAlchemy for data storage and retrieval.


Main.py Explanation:

1) Imports

- The code imports necessary modules and classes. FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Session, Optional, models, schemas, SessionLocal, and engine are imported from respective modules.



2) Database Initialization:

    "models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine): "
- This line creates the database tables defined in the SQLAlchemy models using the engine object.




3) FastAPI Initialization:

    "app = FastAPI(): "

- This initializes a FastAPI application instance.




4) Dependency for Database Session:
    """
    def get_db():
        db = SessionLocal()
        try:
            yield db
        finally:
            db.close()

    """
    This is a dependency function that yields a database session and closes it after its usage.



5) Routes

   - Different endpoints to perform CRUD operations on book and review tables
